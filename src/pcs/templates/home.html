                        <p>
                            The ACM Programming Contest is a coding competition that emphasizes
                            problem solving executed in code. Students, faculty, and staff from all
                            majors and colleges are welcome. The problems are ICPC style coding
                            questions which are similar to questions asked by recruiters during
                            technical interviews.

                            The competition lasts 5 hours, and teams are limited to 3 members. The
                            top teams from each division receive prizes, which have previously included
                            things like Google Home Minis, Amazon Echoes, Raspberry Pies, Chromecasts,
                            and ACM chapter t-shirts.
